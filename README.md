# PyHangman

## 📜 Description

**PyHangman** is a classic hangman game developed in Python, where the player can choose from various themes, such as:

- 🎥 **Movies**
- 🍔 **Foods**
- 🌍 **Countries**
- 🐾 **Animals**

Once the theme is selected, the game randomly picks a word related to that theme, and the player must guess the letters while avoiding getting "hanged" 😅.

This project is being developed as part of the **"Python Programming Foundations for Data Analysis and Data Science"** course, offered for free by **Data Science Academy (DSA)**.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate key concepts learned in the course, such as:

- Data manipulation with Python
- Reading files
- JSON file manipulation
- Building logic for simple games

## 🔧 Features

- Theme selection for the game
- Random word selection based on the chosen theme
- Tracking wrong attempts and visual representation of the hangman
- JSON file manipulation for storing words related to each theme

## 📁 JSON File

The JSON file used in this project was **generated by ChatGPT** and will be manipulated within the game using Python. It contains words categorized by themes and serves as the data source for the random word selection.

> **Note:** The JSON file has not been manually processed by me. It will be directly used and manipulated within the project using Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **JSON**: For data storage and manipulation
